C++ code for finding the distance between words. Distance is defined as the shortest path between the words (two words are connected if they differ exactly at one letter).
For example, "cat" and "car" are neighbours. Additionally, to use the code you need a txt file containing words separated by \n. This file is used to construct the graph representing words.
